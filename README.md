# House-Rental-Database-Management

Data WhereHouse is a housing reviews system that can help people know the basic information of the apartments located around the College Park Area. The main purpose of the project is to provide the future residents with more information about the various aspects of reviews and ratings to make their selection task easier and smoother. We designed the ER Diagram, defined business rules and built relational database to store customer and rental details. We present some potential use cases of our system by executing some queries on the database.

The Repo consists of 2 SQL files, one which was used to construct and populate the database and second one to query the databse. It contains an image of the system's ER Diagram. It also contains the Project Proposal and Report along with the Presentation given to the Professor and the class.
