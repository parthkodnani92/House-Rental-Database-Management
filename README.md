# House-Rental-Database-Management

Data WhereHouse is a housing reviews system that can help people know the basic information of the apartments located around the College Park Area. The main purpose of the project is to provide the future residents with more information about the various aspects of reviews and ratings to make their selection task easier and smoother. We designed the ER Diagram, defined business rules and built relational database to store customer and rental details. We present some potential use cases of our system by executing some queries on the database.
